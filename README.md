# Portfolio

Welcome! This is a React page to showcase some of my web development projects.

## Running Locally

In the terminal, run the following:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Run locally: `npm run start`

## Design
- Webcam images come from the [Windy Webcams API](https://api.windy.com/webcams) narrowed down by Oregon, Washington and mountain regions. One of the results is randomly chosen and a blue noise filter is overlayed on top to try and counteract some of the jpeggyness.
- Laptop background is Bliss by Charles O'Rear.
- Pixel art by <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelArtJourney">Scilex</a>!
- Before refactoring in React, I had used two other JavaScript tools called [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) and [Name That Color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED) to take the average color from the webcam image, define the name, and style various elements around the site.
