              Hi, I'm Katie Churchwell, a full stack engineer with a background
              in education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I earned a Bachelors in International Business with a
              concentration in Marketing from the University of South Florida
              and am a graduate of a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the
              University of Oregon.
            </p>

              Currently working on LearnPlatform at Instructure, an EdTech
              management platform focused on expanding equitable access to
              education through innovative technology. Our tech stack includes
              React, Elixir, and Rails.
